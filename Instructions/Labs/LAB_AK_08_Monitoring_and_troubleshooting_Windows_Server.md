## Exercise 1: Establishing a performance baseline

In this exercise, you will create and start a custom data collector set in Performance Monitor to establish a baseline for the serverâ€™s performance. You will select relevant performance counters, simulate typical server workloads, and collect data. After data collection, you will analyze the performance metrics to establish baseline values that can be used for future comparisons when troubleshooting performance issues.

> **Note**: After starting the Data Collector Set, there might be a delay of 10 minutes for the results to appear.

### Task 1: Create and start a data collector set

## Exercise 2: Identifying the source of a performance problem

In this exercise, you will identify the source of a performance problem by creating additional workloads on the server. You will use the CPU Stress utility to simulate a high CPU load and capture performance data during this time. By comparing the performance data before and during the stress, you will diagnose potential performance issues and identify resource bottlenecks.

### Task 1: Create additional workload on the server

In this task, you will run the CPU Stress utility (CPUStres64.exe) to simulate additional CPU load on SEA-SVR2. This increased workload will help identify performance problems that could arise under stress conditions.

1. On **SEA-SVR2**, open File Explorer.

1. In File Explorer, browse to **C:\Labfiles\Lab08**.

1. Double-click on **CPUSTRES64.EXE**.

   ![](../Media/az-801-lab8-image22.png)

   >**Note**: **CPUSTRES64.EXE** is a SysInternals utility that can be used to simulate CPU activity by running up to 64 threads in a loop.

1. In the **CPUSTRES License Agreement** dialog box, select **Agree**.

    ![](../Media/az-801-lab8-image23.png)
   
1. In the **CPU Stress** dialog box, right-click on the highlighted thread at the top of the list of running threads, select **Activity Level**, and then select **Busy (75%)**.

   ![](../Media/az-801-lab8-image24.png)

### Task 2: Capture performance data by using a data collector set

In this task, you will capture performance data while the server is under the added CPU stress, providing insights into how the server is performing under load and offering comparisons with baseline performance metrics.

1. On **SEA-SVR2**, switch to Performance Monitor.

1. In Performance Monitor, expand **Data Collector Sets**, and select **User Defined**.

1. In the results pane, right-click or access the context menu for **SEA-SVR2 Performance**, and then select **Start**.

   ![](../Media/az-801-lab8-image25.png)
   
   > **Note**: Wait 1 minute to allow the data capture to occur.

### Task 3: Remove the workload and review the performance data

In this task, after removing the CPU stress workload, you will stop the data collector set and review the performance data to determine the impact of the additional workload on system performance.

1. On **SEA-SVR2**, switch to **CPU Stress** dialog box and close it. 

1. Switch to Performance Monitor.

1. In the navigation pane, right-click on the **SEA-SVR2 Performance**, and then select **Stop**.

   ![](../Media/az-801-lab8-image26.png)
   
1. In Performance Monitor, in the navigation pane, expand **Reports (1)**, expand **User Defined (2)**, expand **SEA-SVR2 Performance (3)**, select **SEA-SVR2\_*DateTime*-000002 (4)** (where *DateTime* designates the current timestamp), and then review the report data.

1. On the menu bar, select **Change graph type (5)** or press Ctrl+G, and then select **Report (6)**.

   ![](../Media/az-801-lab8-image27.png)

1. As before, record the values that are listed in the report. Recorded values include:

   - **Memory\\Pages/sec**
   - **Network Interface\\Bytes Total/sec**
   - **PhysicalDisk\\% Disk Time**
   - **PhysicalDisk\\Avg. Disk Queue Length**
   - **Processor\\% Processor Time**

## Exercise 3: Viewing and configuring centralized event logs

In this exercise, you will configure centralized event log management by setting up event forwarding from one server to another. You will enable the necessary prerequisites, such as time synchronization and remote management, and create an event subscription to collect critical events from the source server. You will then verify that the event forwarding is set up correctly and that the events are being received on the target server.

### Task 1: Configure subscription prerequisites

In this task, you will be configuring the prerequisites for event log forwarding, including setting up Windows Remote Management (WinRM), ensuring time synchronization, and enabling the necessary firewall rules on SEA-SVR2 and SEA-DC1.

1. On **SEA-SVR2**, switch to Windows PowerShell.

1. To enable creating and managing subscriptions of events forwarded to **SEA-SVR2**, enter the following command and press Enter:

   ```powershell
   WECUtil qc /q
   ```

1. To ensure that the event source and collector have their local date and time synchronized, enter the following command and press Enter:

   ```powershell
   w32tm /resync /computer:SEA-DC1.contoso.com
   ```

1. To allow WinRM connectivity in case of Kerberos authentication issues, enter the following command and press Enter:

   ```powershell
   Set-Item WSMan:localhost\client\trustedhosts -Value *.contoso.com -Force
   ```

1. To establish a PowerShell Remoting session to **SEA-DC1**, enter the following command and press Enter:

   ```powershell
   Enter-PSSession -ComputerName SEA-DC1.contoso.com
   ```

1. To ensure that Windows Remote Management (WinRM) is enabled on **SEA-DC1**, enter the following command and press Enter:

   ```powershell
   winrm qc
   ```

   > **Note**: Verify that the WinRM service is already running and that it's set up for remote management.

   ![](../Media/az-801-lab8-image29.png)
